<p><strong>What</strong>. 2023 Central Ohio RPM</p>



<p><strong>Where</strong>. <a href="https://g.co/kgs/1w6HyRU">Marion Union Station</a></p>

<p><strong>When</strong>. October 12-14</p>

<p><strong>Why</strong>. Because we can</p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong>. 20.00 for the meet. 10.00 for the cookout. – There is no pre-registration</p>

<p><strong>Lodging</strong>: There is plenty of lodging at US23and Rte95, east of the depot. Here is a <a href="https://www.reservations.com/Hotels/marion-ohio/class/affordable?rmcid=dsa&amp;utm_source=googleads&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_uGmBhBREiwAeOfsdz5acrGc6Ag0fnzaMoRN4MnbZ3nbPOVkpfJ0uaSOZWK-N2q7blwVTxoCfLMQAvD_BwE&amp;fbclid=IwAR3s8YZgb3iEEidXuzVDR2AAfCSC2V1rZ9pm35akH_IurBxAn_3yQBwWpa4">link</a> for you to explore.</p>

<p>Bring models, lots of them. Bring projects that are in progress. Bring friends. Bring an appetite. Bring money, to spend with our vendors. Bring enthusiasm for the hobby and for friendship and fellowship.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, the 12th is set up day.</strong>&nbsp; </p>

<p>That begins around noon.&nbsp; This is for early arrivers and those who wish to give us a hand in preparing the depot for the meet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After set up, there is time for some railfanning around the depot.&nbsp; For those who have never been there, there are 3 set of double track mains at the Depot.&nbsp; There are 2 pairs, one NS, and one CSX, that go north/south through town.&nbsp; On NS, that’s Railroad west.&nbsp; Then there’s a pair of CSX tracks that run east/west. Marion can be very, very busy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around 5 or so, we’ll adjourn to a local steakhouse for dinner.&nbsp; We generally have about 20-25 people for this meal.&nbsp; It’s a GREAT time and one of the highlights of the meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After dinner, for those who care to make the 45 minute drive to Marysville, I’m hosting an open house at the Tampa Northern Model Railroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Friday and Saturday doors open at 8 am.</strong>&nbsp; </p>

<p>This is for those that need to set up their displays.&nbsp; The meet begins at 9am both days and clinics begin shortly there after.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of clinics, FOLKS, I’M IN DESPERATE NEED of folks to present clinics for the meet.&nbsp; Please remember that clinicians get in for free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Firday the meet will shutdown for dinner around 5pm.&nbsp; After dinner, if there is enough interest, we can have a slide/ movie show. Another option is for more folks to come visit the progress on the Tampa Northern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saturday, doors open at 8.&nbsp; After lunch, we will have our door prize drawing.&nbsp; You must be present to win, NO EXCEPTIONS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the door prizes, there will be one of two more clinics and then we will begin cleanup.&nbsp; Once cleanup is accomplished, there is our traditional meet closing cookout.&nbsp; This is an extra fare event.&nbsp; We’ve had to raise the cost to 10.00.&nbsp; This is our first increase for this cookout in many years.</p>
